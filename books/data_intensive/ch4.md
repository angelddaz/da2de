Chapter 4. Encoding and Evolution

Data may be encoded with JSON, XML, Protocal Buffers, Thrift, and Avro

    These formats are used for data storage and for communication. Web services communication: Representational State Transfer (REST) and remote procedure calls (RPC)

Encoding AKA Serialization. This book uses Encoding.

Encoding is really only useful for terrabytes of data. So not much use for me right now.
